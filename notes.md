# Introduction to the Unix Shell

In this session we will look at some aspects
of the bash shell. We will look at how some
aspects of computational science can be 
automated with pipelines and filters, and help everybody
get up to speed before we dive into python after coffee.

To get started you should open a bash shell
and type:

```
cd
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/gracecox/2017-01-18-bristol-bash.git
cd 2017-01-18-bristol-bash
